Analyzing the Weight of Lemurs
================
by Nagaprasad Rudrapatna

## Summary of Project

In this project, I worked with data originally published by the Duke Lemur Center. Using two-level modeling, I sought to answer the following research question: for which types of lemurs do changes over time greatly impact weight measurements? I concluded that changes over time had the greatest influence on the weight measurements of Coquerel's sifakas (among the three species considered) and, more generally, captive-born lemurs (as opposed to those that were wild-born). The relevance of birth type, however, was surprising to me because I did not think that an animal's progression in weight over time (particularly during the young adult and adult phases of life) would be related to the circumstances surrounding its birth. This is an interesting finding that could prove useful to researchers (perhaps at the Duke Lemur Center) who seek to understand the developmental cycles (and growth patterns) of Coquerel's sifakas, red-ruffed lemurs, and black-and-white ruffed lemurs.
